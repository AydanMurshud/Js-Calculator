<h1 align="center">Basic JavaScript Calculator</h1>

<p align="center">This project is written to demonstrate programming skills with JavaScript, SASS/SCSS and HTML.</p>
<p align="justfy">While writing the project, I used my knowledge of classes to create a Calculator class.</p>
<p align="justfy"> We look at the Calculator class as an abstract object exposed in code.</p>
<h3 align="center">What does a calculator physically have?</br> Screen and buttons.</h3>
<p>The screen shows the <b>current number</b> and the <b>previous number</b>.</br>
<img width='500px' src="/imgs/displayTags.png" alt="">
We are using data queries
</p>
Since these are all physical attributes of the calculator, it is appropriate to describe them in HTML.</p>
Languages used:
1. HTML
2. SASS/SCSS
3. vanilla JavaScript
